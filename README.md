Auto HA, is the automatic detection of different (H)uman (A)ctivities,i.e, we will predict "which" activity was performed at a specific point in time, using data recorded of Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

we'll walk through two different models "Decision Tree & Random Forest", and we will choose the most accurate one "maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the out-of-sample error".

As we're going to prove in this document we found that, the Random forest is the most accurate model fit our data and predict activity Type "the output variable /Class" with Overall accuracy 99~%, while the decision tree model overall accuracy is 74~%, and we're going to use Random Forest Model to predict the 20 cases in the test dataset.
